# weather_ai_app

This project implements a weather application leveraging AI for enhanced prediction and personalized weather information.  The application focuses on providing accurate and timely weather updates, incorporating machine learning models to improve forecasting accuracy beyond standard meteorological data. This allows for more precise weather predictions, particularly in areas with limited historical data or complex weather patterns. The long-term goal is to expand the application's capabilities to include hyperlocal forecasting and personalized alerts based on user preferences and activities.

The current implementation provides a basic framework for data acquisition, processing, and presentation.  Future development will include integration with advanced AI models for improved prediction accuracy and the incorporation of user-specific data to personalize the weather experience. The application is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion to incorporate additional weather data sources and sophisticated forecasting algorithms.

This project is designed as a modular and extensible platform. The architecture allows for easy integration of new features and data sources.  The use of Python and Django provides a robust and well-supported foundation for future development.


## Features

*   **Real-time weather updates:** Retrieves current weather data from a reliable API.
*   **AI-enhanced prediction:**  (Future implementation) Utilizes machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.
*   **User-friendly interface:** (Future implementation)  Provides a clean and intuitive interface for accessing weather information.
*   **Personalized alerts:** (Future implementation)  Sends customized alerts based on user preferences.


## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment:  `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Migrate the database: `python manage.py migrate`
6.  Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`


## Usage

The application is primarily accessed through the Django framework.  To view a simple example of accessing data (assuming a future implementation with a view providing weather data):

```python
from weather.models import WeatherData # Assuming a 'WeatherData' model exists

# Fetch the latest weather data (replace with your specific query)
latest_weather = WeatherData.objects.latest('timestamp')

print(f"Temperature: {latest_weather.temperature}")
print(f"Condition: {latest_weather.condition}")
```
